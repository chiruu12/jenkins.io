Chirag is a final-year student at BITS Pilani â€“ Goa Campus, pursuing a dual major in Mathematics and Electronics & Instrumentation. He views AI and NLP not just as fields of study, but as his personal kitchen for innovation. He treats data like ingredients and algorithms like recipes, constantly experimenting to create impactful solutions.

This passion led him to be selected as a Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025 contributor for Jenkins, where he is working on the link:/projects/gsoc/2025/project-ideas/domain-specific-llm-for-jenkins/[Domain-specific LLM for Jenkins failure diagnosis] project.

Beyond his technical pursuits, you can find Chirag either in an actual kitchen experimenting with new culinary dishes, or in his digital one, perfecting the recipe for a smarter AI.
